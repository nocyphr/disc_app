# DISC App

## Business Goal
In order to hire the right person for the right job and create a great team composition
As a hiring manager 
I want to have a tool that lets me categorize their personality type according to the DISC model

Description:
The DISC model identifies four main personality traits: Dominance (D), Influence (I), Steadiness (S), and Conscientiousness (C).
 
Utilizing this model aids hiring managers in:
1. Team Balance: Ensuring diverse teams with a mix of leaders (D), communicators (I), stabilizers (S), and detail-oriented members (C).
2. Role Suitability: Aligning candidates with roles that match their inherent strengths.
3. Streamlined Training: Tailoring onboarding based on individual personality traits.
4. Conflict Minimization: Anticipating and addressing potential team conflicts through understanding of personalities.

This tool, therefore, promises better team dynamics, higher productivity, and reduced turnover by making informed hiring decisions.

## Basic Capabilities
### 1. Assessment Input:
- **Questionnaire**: Implement a DISC-based questionnaire for candidates.

### 2. DISC Scoring System:
- **Automatic Scoring**: Categorize candidates into D, I, S, or C based on responses.
- **Breakdown**: Provide a detailed distribution of each category for each individual (e.g., 50% D, 30% I, 10% S, 10% C).

### 3. Visual Representations:
- **Individual Profiles**: Use pie charts or bar graphs to show an individual's DISC distribution.
